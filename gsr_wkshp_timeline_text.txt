budburst month April
average budburst 2018 April 1 - April 10 April 17 - April 26 2019 April 10 - April 15 April 23 - April 25
late April May begin growth harvest from late August and still harvesting
strong early season growth
didn't water as much - bad idea
flowering mid May
average flowering 2018 May 7 - May 14 May 18 - May 24 2019 May 11 - May 16 May 21 - May 25
wettest May ever, opposite of normal
no significant disease or pest problem
no significant pest issues this year except mal
extra sulfur applications kept pests powdery mildew at bay
mixed bag, May was welcomed, August sucked!
veraison mid-late July
average veraison 2018 July 1 - July 6 July 12 - July 21 2019: July 20 - July 29
growth slowing and shutting down earlier than expected
nitrogen additions in fall
this season: boost last N add of season Next season: intentionally undercrop but wait to see what N boost did
hail first of August
harvest quickly
bees / wasps nearly ruined malvasia
deficit irrigation not helpful
non monsoon  vs monsoon normally turn back water consumption bad move in these circumstances
harvested picpoul blanc in 3rd growing season - vigorous
driest August ever, opposite of normal
concord grapes because of heavy rainfall late spring they took less water during summer months - it seemed!
excessive heat, no monsoon relief result: rapid brix rising, low 20s to high 20s in 96 hours
accelerated harvest schedule
harvest late August
no monsoon, easier to produce quality crop
average harvest 2018 August 5 - August 13 August 30 - September 11 2019 August 19 - August 28
started spread out, finished compact
concord grapes earlier harvest, longer harvest (8 weeks)
dry year
petit syrah is supposedly super great this year
late new vegetative growth after post-harvest N application
heard industry talk 3 days heavy monsoons in Sonoita area deferred harvest of cabernet sauvignon only 21 brix at rainfall
cold / wet winter
more winter moisture equals good initial growth later bud break equals later pruning
three times four inch snowfalls
two separate late frost events
late bud break little spring frost threat
little need for frost protection part of the reason for heavy harvest
late bud break helpful, however, warmer temps limit the treat - chardonnay and sauvignon blanc are tough
wetter winters prior to 2019 pruning later
less water in early season due to rain and snow
windy spring affected flower set in Cabernet Sauvignon and Tannat
cut worm damage at bud break
spray with BT
big fast bud break in April 19th, slowed water to control training
bud break, no frost
late frost - wiped out 50% of fruit
Gewurztraminer always struggle with bud break and frost timing for this location
thrips at flower
spray insecticide and oil
long, cooler growing season
frost May 21, repruned
low soil temperatures (~10F below average)
excessive leaf hoppers
oil sprays
grasshoppers June
no powdery mildew as opposed to prior years
105F high, 15F low, greater extreme temp compared to 2018
Marsanne, Rousanne need more water during bud break
Does Tempranillo always look sad in northern Arizona (like it's always thirsty)? No
excessive fruit - bumper crop year meant more fruit work but great yields
drop fruit, clear canopy for air flow, scramble to find buyers for excess fruit and we overwhelmed the cellar
cooler and wetter spring
early mildew pressure
veg. pruning to promote secondary growth of canopy (got poor results)
more fungicide use
2018 more mildew pressure, 2019 dry/mildew index low
sunburn Malvasia Bianca
vegetative growth shutdown (heat)
lateral growth not as prevalent, more sunburn (Malvasia Bianca)
high brix compounded quick harvest
Tempranillo looked great in 2019, came off before terrible pH
bird damage (Picpoul Blanc) white grapes - no nets
no skeletonizers this year compared to prior years
skeletonizers abundant 2018, 2017, 2016
entire monsoon like typical onset - very patchy, many areas received nothing
no / low rain, more irrigation
Four Corners high far to south?
no powdery mildew, less pests
more growth on younger vines
hot and dry, no monsoon relief
continue to water through fall feedings, ground not charged with water
nonsoon
increase irrigation, lessen leaf pulling, move canopy via crossarms, monitor vine stress via shoot tips
Pinot Noir needed more water during dry summer (2015 summer also) positive (could control brix more)
more water needed late in season due to lack of rain
Viognier comes off before monsoons
powdery mildew first of August, sprayed, hasn't happened before in our upper vineyards
late veraison, compact ripening season
harvest period in 2018 was 7 weeks, harvest 2019 was 4 weeks, hard to get off
seven white varietals ripened all at once - vs last year 2018, in 2019 all in three days, 2018 two weeks to ripen
hail
High tunnels?
2018 harvest was a week early (warmer spring)
hail, Keeling-Shaeffer Dos Cabezas area
Barbera and Anglianico went to raisins in 2019
Tannat and Picpoul had some bird damage
August 15 - August 28 high temps - vines shut down
water as much as possible
Why did it rain in September? Delayed picks, fruit stuck late
very little rain, vines shut down
Petite Syrah seemed to need more water than other varieties
Gewurztraminer harvest same time as last year
Sedona and elsewhere - lower pHs! Great numbers, winter rain?, less potassium?
two week later harvest
later start, viognier first, end August 13, Chardonnay August 21 delayed 12 days, cooler spring
Fiano does well every year, Petite Syrah some sunburn and higher demand for water
10+" rain near Portal, throughout harvest
multitude of sprays, suff-oil, regalia, kicide kept rot away
delayed ripening, fruit still hanging
still harvesting Cabernet Sauvignon and Mouvedre, September rains stalled brix
only pest leaf skeletonizer
spray organically
Freeze October 11 or 12
early October freeze destroyed leaves Cabernet Sauvignon, Mouvedre pick all
Petite Verdot suffered from excessive rains, never ripened completely
carbo-load all varieties for next year
14" snow, 0F temperatures, February
wet winter and spring made start and amount of spring irrigation a guess
250 lbs chicken manure, 2 tons gypsum, February
great water / fertilizer base for initial spring growth
pre-prune, 1-30 March
use of frost shield 2x
frost shield not fully effective
bud break (1 week late)
budbreak, latest on our records (April 2 - April 20)
thrips
sprayed with airplane
bud break, early varietals, April 15-30
frost four times, 15 April - 2 May
devastating winds
chardonnay syrah, very fragile shoots
put a bug zapper in vineyard to kill moths, equals less catepillar larvae
May 7th, last frost, early than usual
late rains
bloom ~3-8 days late
late freeze
bud break late
bud break late varietals, 5-15 May"
very warm June - early August
warm nights (bad)
Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling too hot post veraison
dropped fruit
cool summer, May - July
veraison
veraison 10 days to 2 weeks late
herbicide drift, had to drop all grapes
slow growth - gallons per day 2/3 of last year
pests eating leaves - rabbits, catepillars
2017 July average 1st week, rain daily (fungus issue)
no monsoon to speak of
less issues with tight cluster zinfandel, best zinfandel crop ever
very little pest
spray venom 25 Jul - too early
spray too early - late arrival of beetles
not much measurable rain throughout monsoon season
2017 was much more difficult during ripening
huge wasp problem
skunks!
spray rhyme - quintec three times August - September
need longer period of application = four times (after tropical depression)
much more 2017 pressure
Graciano, Tempranillo, Verdejo, Petit Manseng
very little mildew - didn't need to spray, except copper sulfate
delayed development
harvest start - finish August 22 - September 15
yellow vines August - September
leaf skeletonizer explosion
Bt and Spinosad application
no monsoons August - September, 3" rain September tropical depression
no monsoon a positive
with unpredictable weather we had to postpone picking and it was difficult to find a crew to pick
late harvest this season, rain coming determined the need to pick
Mexican generals (grasshopper) less than year before but smaller grasshoppers plentiful
1) cotton root rot 2) bark on lower trunk was eaten off (xylem and phloem gone)
harvest begins two weeks late
most varietals ripen within three to four weeks
weather - drop in temperature caused used to delay picking
Cabernet Sauvignon harvest 25 October
great year for Zinfandel (zero rot)
